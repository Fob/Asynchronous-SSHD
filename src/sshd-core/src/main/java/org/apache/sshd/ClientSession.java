/**
 * An authenticated session to a given SSH server
 *
 * A client session is established using the {@link SshClient}.
 * Once the session has been created, the user has to authenticate
 * using either {@link #authPassword(String, String)} or
 * {@link #authPublicKey(String, java.security.KeyPair)}.
 *
 * From this session, channels can be created using the
 * {@link #createChannel(String)} method.  Multiple channels can
 * be created on a given session concurrently.
 *
 * When using the client in an interactive mode, the
 * {@link #waitFor(int, long)} method can be used to listen to specific
 * events such as the session being established, authenticated or closed.
 *
 * When a given session is no longer used, it must be closed using the
 * {@link #close(boolean)} method.
